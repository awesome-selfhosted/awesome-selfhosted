Self-hosting is the practice of hosting and managing applications on your own server(s) instead of consuming from [SaaSS](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html) providers.

This is a list of [Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) Software [network services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_service) and [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) which can be hosted on your own server(s). Non-Free software is listed on the [Non-Free](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted/blob/master/non-free.md) page.
